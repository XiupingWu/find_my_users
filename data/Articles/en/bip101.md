## **Introduction: Principles First**
# Social media content strategy guide for indie developers

- Independent developers face challenges: limited resources, lack of marketing budget.
- The core role of social media: not just a marketing channel, but a platform for product co-creation and user connection.

**Core Principles**:
- Educate users before selling; people don't buy because they don't understand how your product solves their problems.
- Good product + Precise channels + Genuine interaction + Continuous improvement = 1000 loyal seed users.
